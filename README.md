# Introduction

In Hawaii's forests, Ohia trees are one of the ecologically important species in native Hawaiian Forests. A new pathogen known as Rapid Ohia Death is a newly identified fungus that threatens native forests. Creating a visualization of the spread of Rapid Ohia Death is critical to communicating the danger this pathogen presents to Hawaii's forests. This software is a tool that helps us show the spread of Rapid Ohia Death. If you have the right data and the computing power, you could use this software to visualize any forest.
